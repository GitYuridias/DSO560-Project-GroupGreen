This folder contains the code implementation of our final selected model, deep neural network, and the predicted results for a subsetted data.

We had out of vocabular errors, so we just performed predictions on the subsetted labelled data as professor mentioned in Slack.

You are welcome to refer to the implementation of XGBoost as a substitute to this model as well, since both algorithms give similar
performance, and both notebooks take about the same time to run.

Please also note that the data preprocessing for this model is performed within the Jupyter notebook itself.

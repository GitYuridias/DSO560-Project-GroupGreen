# DSO560-Project-GroupGreen
Repo for Group Project of DSO 560 - Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing

This repository contains 2 folders for the Group Project for DSO 560. 
Each folder shows different methods on how the team approached the problem.

XGBoost folder contains a notebook using the XGBoost for the chosen attributes. We were able to calculate the accuracy rate for our prediction of the training set.

Our final NN model includes the accuracy rate and an example of what the prediction will look like. Due to the computational limitation, we were only able to make thisÂ predictions on the subsetted labelled data.

This folder contains an .ipynb file that implements XGBoost for selected attributes' classification, involving steps like data loading, 
data cleaning, vectorization of predictors (brand name, product name, product details, product description), training of the model 
itself and prediction on the subsetted labeled data.

Code implementation is done using local functions as the building blocks, which are supplemented by clarifying comments and demonstrations.
As of file's current version, the final output is a list of lists for each class/sublclass that our group chose to predict that contains
classification accuracy rates and a dataframe with sample actual and predicted labels.

Please note that the helper document for data creation ('Preprocessing_Function.py') can be found in the 'Preprocessing' folder.

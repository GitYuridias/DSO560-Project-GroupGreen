This folder contains all data and code related to implementing XGBoost for attributes' classification, with the latter including steps 
like data loading, data cleaning, vectorization of predictors (brand name, product name, product details, product description) and 
training of the model itself. 

Code implementation of the above described steps, stored in 'Model Building (XGBoost).ipynb' file, is done using local functions as 
the building blocks. As of file's current version, the final output is a list of accuracy rates for every class and, if applicable,
subclass that our group chose to predict.

Please note that the helper document for data creation ('Preprocessing_Function.py') can be found in the master branch.
